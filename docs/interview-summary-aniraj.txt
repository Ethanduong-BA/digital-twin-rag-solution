1. Parse job descriptions from `/jobs` folder
2. Generate interview questions using LLM (5 categories)
3. Retrieve profile context via RAG (Upstash Vector)
4. Generate Digital Twin answers with persona prompting
5. Evaluate answers using LLM for scoring and feedback
6. Aggregate scores and generate recommendations

### RAG Configuration
- Vector Database: Upstash Vector
- Embedding Model: Auto-embedding via Upstash
- LLM: Groq LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
- TopK: 6 results per query

### Command to Run
```bash
pnpm run-simulation
```
